Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.

I have carefully followed a test-driven development approach where the approach is broken into unit test cases which are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. This [commit](https://github.com/diyarenny/guide-for-best-practices-CA2/commit/0a96cc81d4b5aa4cdc9bf0873fafe5af872954ad) that shows test-driven development in my code and each method calulates a specific value, such as the average and standard deviation of a set of scores, was tested repeatedly with several sets of inputs. 

For example, method and unit test created for calculating the average a Rubric commit. I made sure that the test covers all aspect of the method to calculate the average and this ensures code coverage is improved and the complexity is reduced.
