### How to choose estimates :
Planning poker helps a team gain a consensus of correct story point approximation for each item. Here’s how it works:
* In a sprint planning meeting, each developer and tester receives a set of cards.

* A backlog item is brought to the table so that the team may ask questions and clarify features.

* When the discussion is closed, each developer and tester privately selects the card that most accurately reflects their estimate.

* When all cards have been selected, the estimators reveal their cards at the same time. If a consensus is met, it’s time to move on to the next backlog item. If the estimates vary, the leaders discuss until they arrived at a consensus.

It’s useful to have a completed matrix on hand for the estimators to reference during planning poker, as it allows for greater consistency across tasks. Also, it’s useful to set a maximum limit (13, for instance). If a task is estimated to be greater than that limit, it should be split into smaller items. Similarly, if a task is smaller than 1, it should be incorporated into another task.

At this point, within your sprint planning meeting, items in the product backlog can be prioritised and divided out amongst the team based on the team’s workload capacity.

### Comparing the difficulty of two tasks with different estimates :

To chose the estimates for the tasks in this project, I determined, the requirements needed to fulfil each task and sizing of all the user stories was initiated by comparing them against the baseline.

While comparing two tasks with different story points, I assigned a point value to each story. Relative values are more important than the raw values. A story that is assigned 2 story points (Test Coverage) is twice as much as a story that is assigned 1 story point (Analysing Results).

### How Velocity of a Sprint is calculated :
Velocity is a measures the amount of work finished by the team in each sprint. It helps the team to identify how much progress they can aim to make in a given sprint. Velocity is calculated by adding all the story points given to each user story that is completed by the end of the sprint. It measures output, but not the outcome.

_Example: Last 3 Sprints_

Sprint 1: 3 user stories x 8 story points = 24

Sprint 2: 4 user stories x 8 story points = 32

Sprint 3: 5 user stories x 8 story points = 40
Total = 96

*Average sprint velocity is 96 ÷ 3 = 32.*

&nbsp; 
### How the velocity metric feeds into the next sprint planning?
During sprint planning, the velocity of a team is served as an input to the next sprint. The previous weeks velocity data is used to enhance its use in scrum to deliver customer value. The change in velocity over previous sprints can help a team measure the change in particular processes that can affect the delivery of measurable customer value.

1. Estimate how much amount can be delivered by a particular date
2. Estimate a date for a committed amount of work to be delivered
3. Understand our goals while fixing the amount of work we will commit for a sprint
